# Who am I?

You most likely know of me as the developer of Boba Watch. Yes. Hi, das mi.
You could be here for a variety of reasons (such as):
 * You just checkin' me out. Hi!!!! Let's be friends :)
 * I sent you here to check out the code here - all my projects are here
  so go through them and lmk if you have questions
 * You're looking to hire me - see [here](#Looking-to-hire-me).

# I'm new to coding/have trouble understanding a concept

Usually people hear from word of mouth that I help people with coding 
concepts/bugs for free and that's true!! I love helping people out so simply 
hit me up either through my school email or if you're my friend on Facebook, 
then hmu there.

I generally only help people out in person since it's a lot easier to gauge 
the way a person learns and this is also purely limited to my time. If I notice 
people are asking me about a certain concept a lot, I will see if I can make a 
quick video tutorial but this is still just an idea.

### Note: This does NOT mean that I will look over your code/do your hw. 

# Looking to hire me

This falls in to one of two categories:
 * You're part of a company that I applied to - cool! You're in the right place
 * You're an entrepreneur/idea person/thinker/intellectual and have an idea

If you're the first guy, feel free to look through my code and judge for yourself 
if I'm at your standards

If you're the second guy, read below:

## I have an idea and want you to help me code it

> **No, sorry :(**

### I'll give you 50% equity

> **No.**

### I have an idea. Would you be interested?

> **No.**

### I-

> **No.**

Learn coding yourself. It's not that hard I promise and I'll help you :)
